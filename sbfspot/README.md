# Home Assistant Add-on: SBFspot

This SBFspot Add-on for Home Assistant connects to your Inverter to get available data and present it as a device and ~10 related entities.

The add-on manages the availability of your inverter by taking the device offline when the add-on is stopped (for whatever reason)

In order for this Add-On to function, you need to have an MQTT broker configured in Home Assistant.
